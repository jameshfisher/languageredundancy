    <h1>Programming language verbosity</h1>

    <p>
      When people discuss "language X vs. language Y",
      one of the key factors under discussion is "verbosity":
      "... but Java is just so verbose!"

      Put another way, Java apparently has a very high level of redundancy.
    </p>

    <p>
      One measure of redundancy in a signal is its compression ratio.
      This is easily computed by comparing the size of code when uncompressed
      to its size when compressed, with, say, gzip.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried this out on each language's most popular three projects on GitHub.
      The results of this are charted below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some observations:

      <ul>
        <li>
          That old criticism of Java is totally right.
          Java is over twice as verbose as the most character-efficient languages.
        </li>

        <li>
          Whitespace-sensitive languages do well in this test.

          This is because curly-brace languages <em>also</em> use whitespace indentation,
          thus encoding the same information twice.
        </li>

        <li>
          I have an untested theory that two things contribute to overall redundancy:

          <ul>
            <li>Syntactic redundancy (<code>"public static void main"</code>)</li>
            <li>Semantic redundancy (lack of support for abstraction, leading to copy-and-paste)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
